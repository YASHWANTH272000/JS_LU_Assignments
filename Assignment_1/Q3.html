/* STRING

A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes
In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes
    1.Double quotes: "Hello".
    2.Single quotes: 'Hello'.
    3.Backticks: `Hello`.
# Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. 
# There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.
# Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us  to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…},*/

/* BOOLEAN 

# The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

# This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.*/
